Create a new controller called EmailReports.

From here create actionDeveloperDaily

In here loop through all developers and create a simple text email report showing the project worked on in the last 24 hours, the tickets worked on, 
ticket status (closed or not), and a link to submit a report if none has been entered.

For testing, we can email all to brian@brians.com until it's approved then we will send daily email to developers using crontab.

Of course, no email for someone that did no work.
